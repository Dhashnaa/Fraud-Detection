        <h2>Significance and Developing Detection System</h2>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Developing a Robust Fraud Detection System Using GBC</p>
        <p>
            Credit card fraud detection is an essential task in the financial industry due to the increasing number of online and offline transactions. 
            The goal of this project is to develop a robust fraud detection system using machine learning, specifically the Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC). 
            Traditional fraud detection methods, such as rule-based systems, fail to address the growing sophistication of fraudulent activities. 
            With machine learning, we aim to create a dynamic system capable of learning from data and adapting to new fraud patterns.

            The project begins with an analysis of the problem definition, emphasizing the growing threats posed by fraudsters in the digital age. 
            The need for real-time fraud detection is critical, as delayed responses can lead to significant financial losses. 
            Machine learning provides a scalable, efficient solution that can detect fraudulent patterns in large datasets. 
            The importance of fraud detection is highlighted across various sectors, including banking,
            e-commerce, and telecom, where it helps prevent unauthorized transactions and ensures regulatory compliance.

        <h2>Evolution from Rule-Based to Machine Learning algorithms GBC and Data Preprocessing</h2>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Machine Learning algorithms GBC and Data Preprocessing</p>
        <p>
            The literature review delves into the evolution of fraud detection systems, from manual and rule-based approaches to machine learning.
            Existing algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are discussed. 
            These methods have their limitations in terms of handling large, imbalanced datasets, which makes GBC a more suitable option for detecting fraud.

            In the proposed system, the project leverages the GBC model to detect fraud by analyzing a dataset sourced from Kaggle.
            The system is designed to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and address the imbalance between fraudulent and legitimate transactions using techniques such as SMOTE.
            The data analysis section focuses on feature selection, scaling, and cleaning, which are crucial steps in ensuring the model’s accuracy and reliability. 
            The imbalance in the dataset is a key challenge, but the oversampling techniques used help create a more balanced dataset for training the model.

        <h2>Implementation of Gradient Boosting Classifier and Evaluation Metrics</h2>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">GBC and Evaluation Metrics</p>
        <p>
            The Gradient Boosting Classifier is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees sequentially, correcting errors at each step.
            This makes it well-suited for imbalanced datasets where fraudulent transactions are rare. 
            The model implementation includes training the GBC model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
            These metrics help determine how well the model distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

            The system’s architecture is presented with a flowchart that outlines the data flow from input (transaction data) to output (fraud detection). 
            The project is further enhanced by integrating the model into a Flask web application,
            allowing users to input transaction details and receive real-time predictions on whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate

        <h2>Fraud Detection Performance Results</h2>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Integration with Flask for Real-Time Detection and Performance Results</p>
        <p>
            The results show that the GBC model performs better than traditional machine learning algorithms, with high accuracy and lower false positives. 
            In conclusion, the project demonstrates the potential of machine learning, particularly Gradient Boosting, in improving credit card fraud detection.
            Future enhancements could include the incorporation of deep learning models and real-time processing for even better fraud prevention capabilities. 
            This system can be adapted for use in real-world applications, providing a scalable and efficient solution for detecting fraud in financial institutions.
